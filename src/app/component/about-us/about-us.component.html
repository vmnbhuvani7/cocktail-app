    This is much less convenient than just pressing Ctrl+B or something similar. I know there is the "Surround with"
    command in Visual Studio, there are customizable keyboard shortcuts etc. so my hope is that the Ctrl+B functionality
    can somehow be achieved in Visual Studio. Is there some clever trick or am I possibly missing something other,
    rather simple?
